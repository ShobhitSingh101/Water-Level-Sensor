# Water-Tank-Level-Sensor

In this project, We maked an Arduino based Water Tank Level Controller System.
This project is based on Arduino and ultrasonic sensors.Ultrasonic sensors are working on the basis of ECHO.
We need to calculate the time of both sound waves travelling time. When they strike obstacles and return to the sensor. After calculation, we have the distance in the result. We used this concept to control the water tank. The water pump is automatically turned on when the water level is low and turned off when the level is high.
